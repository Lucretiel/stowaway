#![no_std]

//! Stowaway is a library for efficiently storing values in a pointer. The
//! main use case for stowaway is as a helpful way to interoperate with
//! libraries that require opaque data to be passed via pointer, such as C
//! libraries expecting a `void*`, `std::RawWaker`, and `boost::context`.
//!
//! The central feature of this library is value packing in a [`Stowaway`]
//! struct. If `T` is not larger than a pointer (that is, if
//! `sizeof(T) <= sizeof(*T))`, then the value is packed directly into the
//! bytes of an opaque pointer value (specifically, a `*mut ()`). This
//! value can then be passed as the context pointer for C-like interfaces,
//! and then converted back into a [`Stowaway`] on the other end.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! The basic lifecycle of a [`Stowaway`] value is as follows:
//!
//! - Create a [`Stowaway`] with [`Stowaway::new`]. This will pack the value
//!   into the space of a pointer, or box it if it's too big.
//! - Convert that value into a pointer with [`Stowaway::into_raw`].
//! - Store that value somewhere, such as in a `RawWaker`, or as a `void*` in
//!   a C API. Recover the value somewhere else.
//! - Convert the pointer back into a [`Stowaway`] with [`Stowaway::from_raw`].
//!   This takes back ownership of the value, so make sure to only do it once,
//!   and discard the pointer afterwards.
//! - Covert the [`Stowaway`] back into a `T`, or use it as a container with
//!   `Deref` / `AsRef` / `DerefMut` / `AsMut`.
//!
//! ## Simple example:
//!
//! ```
//! use stowaway::Stowaway;
//!
//! fn demo_lifecycle<T: Clone + std::fmt::Debug + Eq>(value: T) {
//!     let cloned = value.clone();
//!
//!     let stowed: Stowaway<T> = Stowaway::new(value);
//!     let storage = Stowaway::into_raw(stowed);
//!     // At this point, the storage pointer would be passed into a C API,
//!     // and recovered somewhere else
//!     let new_stowed: Stowaway<T> = unsafe { Stowaway::from_raw(storage) };
//!     let unstowed: T = Stowaway::into_inner(new_stowed);
//!
//!     assert_eq!(unstowed, cloned);
//! }
//!
//! // A small value, like a u16, is stored directly in the pointer. No
//! // allocations are performed in this example.
//! demo_lifecycle(137u16);
//!
//! // A large value, like  `Vec` (which internally is a data pointer and a
//! // pair of usize) cannot fit in a pointer, and will therefore be boxed
//! // when stored in `Stowaway`
//! demo_lifecycle(vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
//! ```
//!
//! # C-like API Example
//!
//! In this example, we create a fake "C like" API. We will store in this API
//! a series of function pointers and context data pointers, which will then
//! be called all at once.
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::cell::RefCell;
//! # use std::fmt::Write;
//! use stowaway::Stowaway;
//!
//! // Fake stdout
//! static mut stdout: String = String::new();
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct EventList {
//!     events: Vec<(fn(*mut ()), *mut())>
//! }
//!
//! impl EventList {
//!     // our fake C API: add a function pointer and a *mut () to a list
//!     // of callbacks to run.
//!     fn add_event(&mut self, fptr: fn(*mut ()), ctx: *mut()) {
//!         self.events.push((fptr, ctx));
//!     }
//!
//!     // For each function pointer added with add_event, call the function
//!     // with the context pointer.
//!     fn run_all_events(self) {
//!         self.events.into_iter().for_each(|(fptr, ctx)| {
//!             fptr(ctx);
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut event_list = EventList::default();
//!
//! // Add some events to the list
//!
//! // Event 1: print a simple number. u16 should easily fit in a pointer,
//! // so this won't allocate anything
//! fn print_u16(value: *mut()) {
//!     unsafe {
//!         let value: Stowaway<u16> = unsafe { Stowaway::from_raw(value) };
//!         writeln!(&mut stdout, "A number: {}", *value).unwrap();
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! event_list.add_event(print_u16, Stowaway::into_raw(Stowaway::new(10u16)));
//! event_list.add_event(print_u16, Stowaway::into_raw(Stowaway::new(20u16)));
//!
//! // Event 2: Print a large array (`[u64; 8]`). This won't definitely won't fit
//! // in a pointer, so stowaway will automatically allocate it for us
//! fn print_big_array(value:  *mut()) {
